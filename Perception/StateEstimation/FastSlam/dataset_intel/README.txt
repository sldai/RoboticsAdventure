Files "xxx.rawlog" are binary files generated through the MRPT library. They can be
visualized, edited, and managed in many ways through the GUI application "RawLog Viewer".

The text files "xxx_LASER.txt" and "xxx_ODO.txt" have been automatically generated
from the binary rawlog by "RawLogs Viewer".

- The "xxx_LASER.txt" file contains one scan range per line. Values are in meters.
- The "xxx_ODO.txt" contains robot pose increments as measured by the odometry. Each 
   line contains 3 values:
      -Ax: Increment in "x", in meters.
      -Ay: Increment in "y", in meters.
      -Aphi: Increment in "phi", in radians. Phi=0 is in the direction of "+X" axis.
